If I have to start a software company, 2 people from my batch whom I will choose as my partner would be-

1. Shreyas Datta - As he is a good backend developer and would be a good support for me in the development. 
His project analysis and critical insights will definately help me and my team to delever best.

2. Ananya Trivedi - As she is a good support for the team and can work and motivate others in the team 
to delever good project in shorter time.
